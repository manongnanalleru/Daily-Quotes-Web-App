Push yourself, no one else will do it for you.
Consistency is key.
Success is not final, failure is not fatal.
You are stronger than you think.
Keep going even when it gets tough.
Dream big. Start small. Act now.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
Believe you can, and you're halfway there.
Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.
Failure is not the opposite of success, it's part of success.
Discipline is doing it even when you don’t feel like it.
The harder you work for something, the greater you’ll feel when you achieve it.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Small progress is still progress.
Focus on your goal. Don’t look in any direction but ahead.
Work hard in silence. Let success make the noise.
You don’t need to be perfect to start. You just need to start.
Winners are not afraid of losing. But losers are.
You are your only limit.
Be stronger than your excuses.
